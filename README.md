# Conference API

This is a simple conference API to add a talk and an attendee as well as remove a talk.

It's made in Node.js, Express, Mongoose and MongoDB.

When I was looking for backend interview assignments, I came across a repo on GitHub that asked the candidates to make a conference API. I thought I should try it for practice and this repo you are right now in is the result of that attempt.
